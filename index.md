## **PROFILE**
Male. born in 2000. Currently study in USTC.   
With great diligence on every course, I have gained remarkable scores and won top level scholership every year. Along with regular courses, I am in the honered class of our college and got good grades in more challenging courses of Operating System, Compilers and so on. Having taken part in CS-relative competitions, I gained experience on CPU design and Parallel Optimization.   
Pursue achievemnets of computer science with fun.

**Fast Sorting Hardware on FPGA**   
- This was a training project for a FPGA competition. 
- Our team made a hardware sorting machine that communicates with a PC and sort number arrays under linear complexity.
- I designed the core sorting circuit,which realized a parallel bubble sort with low energy cost and small circuit scale.

**High Security Sandbox for Linux**

- Team project for Operating System honored course.
- By injecting customized module into the kernel, our sandbox redirected the chosen program’s reading and writinging address,including Copy-On-Write Mechanism.
- I wrote the front-end and real-time module compilation for injection.

**Parallel Application Challenge 2021**

- On behalf of our College, my team competed in PAC.
- We together parallelized and optimzed the 3D image reconstruction of Cryo-electron microscopy. By using the mix of OpenMP and MPI, and optimizing code compilation, we made the process 100 times faster.
