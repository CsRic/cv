## **PROFILE**
Male. born in 2000. Currently study in USTC.   
With great diligence on every course, I have gained remarkable scores and won top level scholership every year. Along with regular courses, I am in the honered class of our college and got good grades in more challenging courses of Operating System, Compilers and so on. Having taken part in CS-relative competitions, I gained experience on CPU design and Parallel Optimization.   
Pursue achievemnets of computer science with fun.

## **PROJECTS & EXPERIENCE**

<p align="right">10/2020 – 11/2020</p> 
 
**Fast Sorting Hardware on FPGA**   
- This was a training project for a FPGA competition. 
- Our team made a hardware sorting machine that communicates with a PC and sort number arrays under linear complexity.
- I designed the core sorting circuit,which realized a parallel bubble sort with low energy cost and small circuit scale.

**High Security Sandbox for Linux**

- Team project for Operating System honored course.
- By injecting customized module into the kernel, our sandbox redirected the chosen program’s reading and writinging address,including Copy-On-Write Mechanism.
- I wrote the front-end and real-time module compilation for injection.

**Parallel Application Challenge 2021**

- On behalf of our College, my team competed in PAC.
- We together parallelized and optimzed the 3D image reconstruction of Cryo-electron microscopy. By using the mix of OpenMP and MPI, and optimizing code compilation, we made the process 100 times faster.

**Unihack 2021**

- My team joined a hackthon hosted by UCLA students. We made a game based on the topic: Make Life Better against COVID-19.
- Our game, IMPCHAT: Reconnecting by Predicting, is a questionnaire of many general questions to be answered with natural sentences. Our program compared the semantic similarity of different people's answers to tells people if he/she really knows the person on the other side. We hope this game could reconnect people separated by COVID-19 in a innovative way.
- Proposing the game during brainstorm, I utilized Bert, a NLP model, to make the semantic similarity comparison more presice.

**SysYF Coding Language Compiler**

- From lexical and parsing analysis to compiling optimization, I programmed a C-like language compiler by hand.
